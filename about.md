# OpenPhantom Cockpit Project
OpenPhantom is a project of community members who desire to build standardized home constructible simulator cockpit for the F-4E Phantom. This project aims to represent the F-4E as simulated by the HeatBlur module for DCS World.

This project is just starting at this point, most of our work can be found on our discord.
